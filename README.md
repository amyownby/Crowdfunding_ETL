# <Your-Project-Title>
project 2 

## Description -
For the ETL mini project, we worked together to practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and  Python dictionary methods to extract and transform the data. We created four CSV files and used the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally we  uploaded the CSV file data into a Postgres database.
